### Advice generator Project
   I practiced working with APIS using the fetch API and the advice generator API. The site generates a random advice anytime the button is clicked. View it live [here](https://eno-advice-generator.netlify.app/) <a href="https://eno-advice-generator.netlify.app" target="_blank">here</a>

### GitHub API Project
   I continued working with APIS using the fetch API and the GitHub API. The site allows users to fecth information from the API by searaching for a valid GitHub user. View it live [here](https://eno-github-api.netlify.app/)
