### Advice generator Project
   I practiced working with APIS using the fetch API and the advice generator API. The site generates a random advice anytime the button is clicked. View it live [here](https://eno-advice-generator.netlify.app/)

   I continued working with APIS using the fetch API and the GitHub API. The site allows users to fetch information from the API by searaching for a valid GitHub user. View it live [here](https://eno-github-api.netlify.app/)
   
### Tip Calculator Project
  I've noticed that as I build more projects, I am getting more fascinated with JavaScript. The most intersting part of this project was the JavaScript. I am therefore going to commence a journey to brush up my JavaScript. View the live tip calculator app [here](https://eno-tip-calcualtor.netlify.app/)
